# Product Requirements Document: Implement Bundle Best Practices

## Introduction/Overview

The Simensen Symfony Message Tracing Bundle currently provides basic causation and correlation tracing functionality but lacks production-ready implementation following Symfony bundle best practices. This feature will transform the bundle from a basic proof-of-concept into a professional, production-ready Symfony bundle that can be confidently used by Symfony developers in their applications.

The primary problem this solves is making the bundle reliable, well-documented, and maintainable for real-world usage, particularly addressing critical middleware registration issues and missing infrastructure components.

## Goals

1. **Fix Critical Middleware Registration**: Resolve the core issue where envelope managers are registered but actual Symfony Messenger middleware services are missing
2. **Establish Production-Ready Infrastructure**: Implement comprehensive testing, documentation, and quality assurance processes
3. **Ensure Bundle Reliability**: Make the bundle production-ready with proper error handling and validation
4. **Provide Excellent Developer Experience**: Create clear documentation and examples for easy adoption

## User Stories

**As a Symfony developer**, I want to integrate message tracing into my application so that I can track causation and correlation across distributed systems without worrying about bundle reliability or configuration complexity.

**As a bundle maintainer**, I want comprehensive tests and documentation so that I can confidently release updates and handle community contributions without introducing regressions.

**As a DevOps engineer**, I want clear troubleshooting documentation so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve tracing issues in production environments.

## Functional Requirements

### Phase 1: Critical Middleware Implementation (Highest Priority)

1. **Create Actual Middleware Classes**: Implement `CausationMiddleware` and `CorrelationMiddleware` classes that properly implement Symfony's `MiddlewareInterface`
2. **Fix Service Registration**: Register middleware services with proper tagging for Symfony Messenger auto-discovery
3. **Enable Automatic Registration**: Configure middleware to be automatically registered when the bundle is installed
4. **Implement Proper Service Aliasing**: Ensure all trace-related services are properly aliased and accessible

### Phase 2: Configuration and Validation

5. **Add Configuration Validation**: Implement comprehensive validation for all configuration options with helpful error messages and suggestions
6. **Create Configuration Reference**: Document all available configuration options with examples and default values
7. **Support Multiple Configuration Formats**: Ensure YAML, XML, and PHP configuration formats are supported
8. **Add Environment-Specific Options**: Provide development vs production configuration recommendations

### Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure

9. **Create Unit Test Suite**: Implement comprehensive unit tests covering all configuration scenarios and service registration
10. **Add Integration Tests**: Test middleware functionality with actual Symfony Messenger integration
11. **Implement Functional Tests**: Create end-to-end tests demonstrating real tracing scenarios
12. **Add Configuration Tests**: Test all configuration variations and validation scenarios

### Phase 4: Documentation and Examples

13. **Create Comprehensive README**: Write detailed installation, configuration, and usage documentation
14. **Add API Documentation**: Document all public services, interfaces, and configuration options
15. **Provide Usage Examples**: Create practical examples showing common tracing scenarios
16. **Include Troubleshooting Guide**: Document common issues and their solutions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Performance Optimization**: While the bundle should be performant, detailed performance tuning is not part of this initial implementation
- **UI/Admin Interface**: No web-based administration interface will be created
- **Advanced Tracing Features**: Complex tracing features beyond causation and correlation are out of scope
- **Multi-Transport Support**: Focus on Symfony Messenger only, not other message systems
- **Backward Compatibility**: This is a new bundle, so no legacy compatibility concerns

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies and Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with Symfony 6.4+ and 7.0+
- Must work with PHP 8.2+
- Should integrate seamlessly with existing Symfony Messenger configuration
- Must not introduce breaking changes to current basic functionality

### Architecture Decisions
- Use `AbstractBundle` approach (already implemented) rather than traditional Extension classes
- Implement proper dependency injection with service tagging
- Follow Symfony's service naming conventions (`simensen_message_tracing.*`)
- Use modern PHP features and type declarations

### Integration Points
- Symfony Messenger middleware pipeline
- Symfony DependencyInjection container
- Symfony Configuration component for validation
- PHPUnit for testing infrastructure

## Success Metrics

### Production Readiness Criteria
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage across all components
- **Documentation Completeness**: README, API docs, and usage examples fully complete
- **Configuration Validation**: All configuration options properly validated with helpful error messages
- **Middleware Functionality**: Both causation and correlation tracing working correctly in integration tests
- **Bundle Installation**: Can be installed and configured in a fresh Symfony application without issues

### Quality Gates
- All PHPStan level 9 checks passing
- All PHP-CS-Fixer style checks passing
- All PHPUnit tests passing
- Successful integration with a sample Symfony application
- Clear documentation that a junior developer can follow

## Open Questions

1. **Service Naming**: Should we maintain the current `simensen_message_tracing.*` naming convention or consider a shorter prefix?

2. **Middleware Ordering**: How should the causation and correlation middleware be ordered relative to other common Symfony Messenger middleware?

3. **Error Handling**: Should tracing failures be silent, logged, or throw exceptions? What's the appropriate failure mode?

4. **Configuration Flexibility**: How much configuration flexibility should be provided vs. opinionated defaults?

5. **Performance Monitoring**: Should the bundle include built-in performance monitoring or leave that to external tools?

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Week 1)
- Fix middleware registration and service definitions
- Create basic middleware classes
- Implement automatic service registration

### Phase 2: Quality Infrastructure (Week 2)
- Add configuration validation
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Set up proper bundle structure

### Phase 3: Documentation and Polish (Week 3)
- Write comprehensive documentation
- Create usage examples
- Add troubleshooting guides
- Final testing and validation

This phased approach ensures critical functionality is addressed first while building a solid foundation for long-term maintainability.
